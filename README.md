# GPSBUZZ
A location based alarm
GPSBUZZ uses Google API s to predict the route you need to take from your source to your destination - by Car, Transit, Cycle or Walk. 
Choose any means of transport, choose a location to be alerted at, set the range in which you want to be alerted, add reminders and save 
yourself a lot of worry and a lot more of time. 

You keep forgetting to hit your local supermarket and buy some essentials despite driving past it several times a day? Just set an alert 
on the App and you will be reminded when you drive past.Are you an office goer or college student who needs to wake up early in the morning 
for a long journey and would love that precious few extra minutes of sleep ? Or are you certain that you will doze off and miss your stop ? 

This is for you!

Continue driving in cruise control without having to worry about where the next exit is or if you have driven past your destination. Don't 
think twice to hop on to a bus or train in a new country. You will now know where to get off and when to get off. So, more power to you!
